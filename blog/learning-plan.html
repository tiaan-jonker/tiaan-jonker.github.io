          <h4 class="article-title">Long term goal and career pathway</h4>
          <p>
            My long-term career path / goal is the same as my previous answer below. What I would add is that I (and this might sound like a cliche and I am fine with that) want to leave the world a bit better by the end of my time. Be it through good relationships, making a positive impact with/through technology, being an inspiration (through my own excellence of character) or to mentor someone. That would be my definition of success and a fulfilling long term goal.
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title">Strengths and limitations during bootcamp</h4>
          <p>
            Learning, resiliency and adaptability has luckily remained consistent strengths of mine during foundations and I think it will serve me well during bootcamp. I discovered during foundations that I do have the capacity to persevere despite how hard a challenge might be, and having aan overall mission (like the above) helps. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one caveat to my perseverance though, which is a limitation of mine that was prevalent throughout foundations. I am able to persevere and stick to a problem, but only after the initial 10 to 20 minutes discomfort of planning, thinking, and struggling. I would oftentimes switch context because of that discomfort which has its obvious drawbacks. I do enjoy a challenge, but that is only after I allowed my mind to settle in general and on the problem. It's almost as if my brain is saying 'Ok fine. I see you are still doing this thing? Let's get to work then.' After that, I am able to focus, learn, adapt and persevere which can be deeply satisfying. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing the above I can intentionally compensate for my limitations by recognising what is happening and then gently, but firmly, telling myself that it's time to work. There is a quote from Steven Pressfield that comes to mind when I can't sit down and settle. It is in the context of writing but I believe it can be applied to programming as well: 
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <i>"There's a secret that real writers know that wannabe writer don't, and the secret is: it's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write. What keeps up from sitting down is Resistance."</i>
          </blockquote>

          <h4 class="article-title">Biggest non-technical challenge during bootcamp</h4>
          <p>
            My biggest challenge might be the steep learning curve. While I do enjoy learning, and that whole journey, I enjoy it most when I understand something almost in its entirety. If I don't then I will take my time until I do. During bootcamp I would have to be comfortable with moving on from a topic when I might not have mastered it as much as I would like. That would mean I would have to adapt my strategy form completeness to good enough and being as resourceful as I can along the way. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title">Non-technical human skills that I want to develop</h4>
          <p>
            The number one human skill that I want to develop would be to work along side and with other people in the context of programming. I am very interested to see how that pans out. Particularly because each person has their own preference and style of writing code. And each person is at a different level of mastery. I can image that trying to navigate that will be a test of ones own emotional intelligence. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title">Expectations from the bootcamp team</h4>
          <p>
            I would expect the team to treat everyone, including myself, with resect every step of the way. I expect the team to help me on my learning journey, to challenge my thinking and solutions. I expect the team to be open to any questions and help everyone with compassion and empathy. I don't expect the team to provide the solutions and walk away but I do expect each engagement to be informative, pleasant, and walk away having learned something. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title">Expectations of myself</h4>
          <p>
            From myself I would expect the following:
          </p>
          <div class="blog-list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                To start with a fresh mind each day and live in the moment, putting aside any discomfort or unpleasant feeling I might have had the previous day, and not being anxious about the next day.
              </li>
              <li>
                That I will give my absolute best and my full effort each day, for each challenge, problem, presentation or whatever task that I need to complete. 
              </li>
              <li>
                That I will treat every person with respect and dignity and that I will try and improve my own emotional intelligence as the course progresses. 
              </li>
              <li>
                That I will be receptive to any feedback coming my way (be they good or bad) that might reveal any blind spots. That I will be open to new and better ways of doing things. 
              </li>
              <li>
                That I lend a helping hand and teach if it is appropriate to do so and I have to the time to spare. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Lastly, that I will have enough self-respect not to waste my time during bootcamp, that I will maximise my learning efficiency, but that I also look after my own well being and nurture my closest relationships no matter the pressure I am under. 
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h4 class="article-title">Long term goal and career pathway</h4>
          <p>
            My long-term career path would be to work in the Tech space as a full-stack developer. My
            long-term goal would be to work with people that align with my values and that I enjoy working
            with and vice-versa. Ultimately I want to work on something that is meaningful, all while enjoying
            the journey and be happy. Amongst that, with time and patience, I want to become a pragmatic
            programmer.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title">Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h4>
          <p>
            One of my major strengths is that I enjoy learning. Coincidently, that will come in handy while
            I'm on this learning journey. Going from zero to competent is deeply satisfying for me so my
            journey at Dev Academy will be extremely enjoyable (with a fair bit of challenge to look forward
            to). If I need to learn something quickly I can be quite resourceful at procuring and weeding
            through complex information (aka google-it for short).
          </p>
          <p>
            The other strength would be a combination of resiliency and adaptability. Inevitably challenges
            will arise but it’s our response to them that matters. I always try to adapt when things change
            and to bounce back quickly when I fail. Having such a mindset is key.
          </p>
          <p>
            My biggest limitation would be my perception on what counts as "action" or working towards an end
            goal. I often don’t count planning as action so I would just jump straight in and make it up as I
            go along. I am learning to slow down and take smaller steps, which includes planning and just
            thinking (they too count as action). The second would be a need for things (or my knowledge about
            something) to be perfect. I would often times review, refactor, review, redo, review, reread… it
            can be stressful and prevent me from moving on and doing / learning other things. As discussed
            further below I am learning to be ok with "good enough".

          </blockquote>
          <h4 class="article-title">Development of Non-technical human skills</h4>
          <p>
            I have been curious for a long time on how software developers plan and build an app together. In
            that regard I am curious to learn how to do it and work effectively as a team. Through that I
            learn how to give and receive feedback, practice active listening, discover gaps in my emotional
            intelligence that needs improving, as well as sharpening my communication skills. Those aspects is
            what I want to learn in the human skills component of the course.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title">Managing workload</h4>
          <p>
            The key to my success on this learning journey would hang on my ability and commitment to look
            after myself and setting daily goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In respect of looking after myself: getting adequate sleep is the best
            <a href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1438316907598258177?lang=en" class="general-links"
              >nootropic</a
            >
            there is and that is something I vow not to sacrifice. It has been proven over and over that the
            best way to learn, focus, be productive, to recharge, regulate emotion etc. is to get adequate
            sleep. Of course, at times, I would need to put in some extra work but on the whole I will make
            sure to get int he sleep and rest I need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, I will ensure that I eat healthy, meditate regularly and that I keep on going for a run
            three times a week at minimum. Looking after myself will help me stay in a good emotional mindset.
            That will ultimately assist with managing my workload because I will be more effective and
            productive as a result. There is nothing worse than having to repeat things over and over due to a
            foggy and unfocused mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then in respect of goals: I will set daily goals so that I know what I am working on and to track
            how my progress is going by reflecting on whether I'm on track or not. Adaptability in this regard
            is also important. I might be derailed due to new information, changing circumstance or a fresh
            issue; being flexible and not dogmatic will be important to completing my tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            If things are building up I will take stock of where I am and what I need to do. This will involve
            prioritising the most important tasks and being ok with “good enough”. I will also be sure to ask
            questions of my facilitator and/or fellow students for help if I am completely blocked and can’t
            progress. If things are getting to me I often find that going for a walk, a run, or meditating
            helps me regain my focus and clarity.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title">Seeking help (in a timely manner)</h4>
          <p>
            Depending on the issue that I am facing I will always search for the solution myself first. If I
            am still blocked I will ask my cohort on Slack, or in person for assistance. If I still can’t find
            a solution I will go to my facilitator for guidance. The timing for asking for assistance would
            depend on my tasks and goals for that day. I hope to have a general idea of how long I will take
            to accomplish something. That way I will be able to ask for help in a timely manner before I run
            out of it and derail my progress.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title">Expectations of facilitation team</h4>
          <p>
            I expect the facilitation team to help guide me through challenges and problems. I would want to
            be shown possible avenues for solutions (but of course not <strong>the</strong> solution) and also
            to be challenged on what I have come up with (maybe there is abetter way?). I would expect honest
            feedback that would help me better uncover my blind spots (be they technical or human skills).
            Finally I trust that they will have empathy for me and respond appropriately to my questions and
            where I am at.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title">Block-out times during bootcamp</h4>
          <p>
            At this stage those closest to me fully understand my time commitment to this journey and what to
            expect of it and of me. They respect my decision and time and I already have their full support.
            As such there is no major external commitments that would take a significant amount of my time
            during foundations or bootcamp.
