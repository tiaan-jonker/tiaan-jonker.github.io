        <blockquote><i>"Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. 
          And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to 
          find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe 
          learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson."

        <h4 class="article-title">Long term goal and career pathway</h4>
        <p>My long-term career path would be to work in the Tech space as a full-stack 
          developer.  My long-term goal would be to work with people that 
          align with my values and that I enjoy working with. I want to work on something 
          that makes a meaningful impact on the people around me all while enjoying
        what I am doing.</p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Strengths and limitations in relation to learning
        </h4>
        <p>One of my major strengths is that I enjoy learning which, coincidently, 
          will come in handy while I am learning to programme. Going from zero to 
          competent is deeply satisfying for me so my journey at Dev Academy will be 
          extremely enjoyable. I can be resourceful at procuring and weeding through complex 
          information while learning (aka google-it for short). 
        </p>
        <p>
          The other strength would be a combination of resiliency and adaptability. 
          Inevitably challenges will arise but it’s our response to them that matters. 
          I always try to adapt when things change and to bounce back quickly when I fail. 
          Having such a mindset can help with this major learning journey I am on. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest limitation would be my bias for action. I often don’t count planning 
          as “action” so I would just jump straight in. I am learning to slow down and 
          take smaller action steps, which includes planning and just thinking. The second 
          would be a need for things (or my knowledge about something) to be perfect. I 
          would often times review, refactor, review, redo, review, reread… it can be 
          stressful and prevent me from moving on and doing / learning other things.
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Development of Non-technical human skills
        </h4>
        <p>I have been curious for a long time is how software developers plan and build 
          an app together. So I would like to learn how to do so effectively. </p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Managing workload
        </h4>
        <p>The key to my success in this learning journey would hang on my commitment to 
          look after myself and setting daily goals. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In respect of looking after myself: getting adequate sleep is the best 
          <a href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1438316907598258177?lang=en" class="general-links">nootropic</a>
          there is and that is something I vow not to sacrifice. It has been proven over 
          and over that the best way to learn, focus, be productive, to recharge etc. is 
          to get adequate sleep. Secondly I will ensure that I eat healthy, meditate 
          regularly and that I keep on going for a run three times a week at minimum. 
          Looking after myself will help me stay in a good emotional mindset. That will 
          ultimately assist with managing my workload because I will be more effective 
          and productive as a result. There is nothing worse than having to repeat things
          over and over due to a foggy, unfocused mind. 
        </p>
        <p>Then in respect of goals, setting daily goals so that I know what I am working 
          on and track how my progress is going by refection on whether I achieved those 
          goals or not. Adaptability in this regard is also important. I might be derailed
          due to new information, changing circumstance or a fresh issue; being flexible 
          and not dogmatic will be important to stay on track. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If things are building up I will take stock of where I am and what I need to do. 
          This will involve prioritising the most important tasks and being ok with 
          “good enough”. I will also be sure to ask questions of my facilitator and/or 
          fellow students to help if I am completely blocked and can’t progress. If things 
          are getting to me I often find that going for a walk or meditating helps 
          regain my focus and clarity. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Seeking help (in a timely manner)
        </h4>
          <p>Depending on the issue that I am facing I will always search for the solution 
            myself first. If I am still blocked I will ask my cohort on Slack, or in 
            person for assistance. If I still can’t find a solution I will go to my 
            facilitator for guidance. When I ask for assistance would depend on my tasks 
            and goals for that day. I hope to have a general idea of how long I will take 
            to accomplish something. That way I will be able to ask for help in a timely 
            manner before I run short of time. 
          </p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Expectations of facilitation team
        </h4>
          <p>I expect the facilitation team to help guide me through challenges and 
            problems. I would want to be shown possible avenues for solutions and also to 
            be challenged on what I have come up with. I would expect honest feedback that
            would help me better uncover my blind spots (be they technical or human skills).
            Finally I trust that they will have empathy for me and respond appropriately 
            to my questions and where I am at. 
          </p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Block-out times during bootcamp
        </h4>
        <p>At this stage those closest to me fully understand my time commitment to his 
          programme and what to expect of it. They respect my decision and time and I will 
          have their full support. As such there is no major external commitments that 
          would take a significant amount of my time.</p>
