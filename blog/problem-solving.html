          <h4 class='article-title'><strong>Pseudocode</strong></h4> 
          <p>
            Writing pseudo is an area I still need to develop. I much prefer to just dive in and solve the solution as I code. But knowing that I can stop myself, think and then write the steps out.
          </p>
          <h4 class='article-title'><strong>Trying something</strong></h4> 
          <p>
            I love to experiment. I’m always open to trying something new that I have thought of or have seen elsewhere. It might not always lead to the desired outcome, but along the way I learn how this mysterious and unforgiving language called JavaScript operates.
          </p>
          <h4 class='article-title'><strong>Ducky method</strong></h4> 
          <p>
             I don’t have a rubber ducky or action figure physically with me. But I oftentimes explain things to an imaginary person in my head, whether to a historical figure or otherwise.  
          </p>
          <h4 class='article-title'><strong>Reading error messages</strong></h4> 
          <p>
            With trying something new or tinkering I run into a lot of errors. That is a good thing because I am starting to understand what is going wrong or why certain things don’t work. If I don’t know what the errors mean then I just google it. I’ve become way better and I am comfortable with reading error messages.
          </p>
          <h4 class='article-title'><strong>Dr Google: </strong></h4> 
          <p>
            when I heard devs google stuff all the time I never understood it. Then I embarked on this learning journey. But at the start of my programming journey, I felt guilty about googling so many things. I wanted to commit everything to memory. That was a mistake and I realised it early on. Now consult with Dr Google very often and I’ve become better with know to search more strategically.
          </p>
          <h4 class='article-title'><strong>console.log-ger: </strong></h4> 
          <p>
            I am a serial one at the that. Its likely the best method to check you are not going crazy. I console.log almost everything because it gives me an idea of what’s going on under the hood. I check simple things like a console message when you click a button. I that because as your programme gets bigger it becomes harder to find errors and bugs. So console log-ing along the way is a must for me.
          </p>
          <h4 class='article-title'><strong>Asking peers/coaches for help: </strong></h4> 
          <p>
            I am comfortable asking questions if I don’t understand something. It also helps uncover my own blind spots. What I do need to become better at is asking questions in a more timely manner.
          </p>
          <h4 class='article-title'><strong>Reflect</strong></h4> 
          <p>
            reflecting is a technique I really enjoy and I believe it helps to increase my craft at a much faster pace. Especially after solving a difficult problem I would sit and think on how I solved it and how I can do better next time. When I learned something new I will also review what that new thing is and how it worked. Admittedly I don’t always write out what I have learned, but I do take the time to reflect on it after the fact or at the end of the day.
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title">Overthinking a simple problem</h4>
          <p>
            On the second challenge of the DOM interactions I got blocked on what I considered to be a simple problem. I needed to update the counting function so that it counts how many blue, green and invisible dots there are and add that totals. I tried many different ways but I couldn't get my function to do what I wanted. After struggling and leaving the problem until the next day I reached out and asked for guidance on slack. Someone helped by challenging my thinking and suggesting a different approach the problem. All I really needed to do was to access each dot that had a class of "blue", "green", or "invisible" added to it when clicking on the circles. But the way I went about doing it was wrong. I can then count the number of those instances in the array that is returned and then add it to the totals object. It was so simple but I was over-thinking it. On reflections what I should have done is to break the problem down with pseudocode and explaining to myself what I need to do with each step. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title">Complex problems: elegant solutions</h4>
          <p>
            I got stuck on the fizzBuzz challenge, which is of course difficult. But I got stuck at a point I did not expect it (I will try my best to not spoil the problem/solution for the rest of my Dev Academy friends.) Though the problem on ths surface seems hard I made sense of it with pseudocode. All of it consisted of a series of simple problems to solve. So I took a few mindful breaths to become calm and alert and went about coding. 
          </p>
          <p>
            What I had produced, though, was completely wrong. I was getting frustrated and annoyed because I thought my solution should work. I googled, tried different methods, console.logged many times, explained things to my imaginary friend. But I overcomplicated everything. I stepped away, took a few breaths and approached the problem with a fresh mindset. I decided to start over and completely understand the unit tests, broke it down step by step... and then it worked. Sometimes the solution to the most complex problems is elegantly simple:
