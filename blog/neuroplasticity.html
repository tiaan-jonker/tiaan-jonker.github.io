          <h4 class="article-title">Neuroplasticity</h4>
          <p>
            What is it? Breaking the word down there is <i>Neuro</i> which is for "neuron", being the nerve
            cells in our brains. Then <i>plastic</i> which is for the changeable and modifiable nature of the
            neurons. Together they form neuroplasticity which refers to our brains ability to change and
            re-organise itself. The anatomy of the brain is not fixed, it can change.
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title">Neuroplasticity benefits</h4>
          <p>
            The fact that our brains are plastic is great news for everyone. Our minds are malleable, its
            plastic; if people go about their lives mindfully and intentionally improving a skill, learn
            something, reading, going to therapy, or whatever with the mindset that their brains are being
            changed I think they will be more motivated to continue and reap the benefits. Just this knowledge
            itself can improve performance, how amazing! In addition if people understand that if they don't
            regularly practice whatever activity they are pursuing their brain will make space and prune away
            the hard acquired neurons - "use it, or lose it". 
            <p>
              In effect "we become what we repeatedly do".
              Every thought and action shapes our brain, it strengthens the neural path ways. Therefore we need to be mindful of what activities we
              engage in and the thoughts we entertain.
            </p>
          </p>
          <h4 class="article-title">Neuroplasticity principles and implementation</h4>
          <p>SOme of the neuroplasticity principles and how it can implemented into my life are the following:</p>
          <div class="blog-list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Remind myself</strong> that my brain can change. The skills and knowledge I possess
                now can be developed and build upon. My brain isn't fixed, its plastic.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>"Use it or lose it"</strong> - practice your skills everyday. Use something that you
                have learned a few times so that it becomes part of your long term memory. If you don't use it
                you will lose it. .
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Repetition</strong> - to change your brain you need sufficient repetition. Repeat
                until it becomes muscle memory. But don't be mindless! Experiment, pay attention, and
                comprehend what you're learning. This will strengthen the neural pathways.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>"Cells that fire together wire together!"</strong> - when you perform some task that
                calls upon other areas of your knowledge as well it will strengthen your connections. Don't
                just look at concepts in isolation, see if you can connect them in a broader context.
                Basically I live for those AHA! moments.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h4 class="article-title">Ways to increase Neuroplasticity</h4>
          <p>Not only are our brains plastic there are ways to increase out brains neuroplasticity. Watch this video to discover some easy, actionable ways that I will be using to increase mine:</p>

          <h4 class="article-title">Growth mindset - what is it?</h4>
          <p>
            Growth mindset is the belief system that your abilities, talents and intelligence are not fixed;
            they can be developed and improved with deliberate practice. It also offers a different
            perspective on the challenges we face. When we face complex issues, and fail, we automatically
            think of the failure as an exposure of our lack of talent and intelligence. A different way of
            thinking about failures is that it only reveals our intelligence and capabilities at that
            given moment; it can be improved. That is a growth mindset. In the context of programming having a growth mindset is going to be the key to success.
            Learning to program is a monumental task. Its a deep rabbit hole that you can get lost in, and
            very quickly you are slammed with your own inadequacies. But a reminder now then that you are learning, developing,
            growing, and on the road to becoming a programmer can help. Keep in mind that you are not yet a full fledged programmer, but
            by persisting, before long, you will be.

          <h4 class="article-title">Growth mindset and my learning journey</h4>
          <p>
            To always just have a growth mindset can be difficult, so I will follow Jame Clear's advice: I will
            develop a growth mindset through tiny actions and victories. Start small and solve problems. With
            time, through action, I can cultivate the desired mindset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, the stories we tell ourselves is also important. We can influence our thoughts and ultimately change
            our lives because those very thoughts can change our brains. At times, when I
            face difficulty, I would have thoughts of inadequacy or not feeling capable. That is my default fixed mindset setting.
            But through self awareness I can capture those thoughts and change them. Essentially
            <strong>I need to tell myself a different story each times this happens.</strong>
            From time to time I need remind myself that:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <i
              >"My mind is not fixed it can change; my intelligence and abilities can be developed. I need to
              embrace challenges and persist through obstacles because that exerted effort combined with
              deliberate practice is the path to mastery. Whenever I receive feedback: learn from it. See
              others success not as my failure but take inspiration from them and use that to propel yourself
              forward. The hand you are dealt with is only the starting point of your development. When you
              fail, remember to give yourself a <strong>"not yet"</strong> grade."</i
            >
