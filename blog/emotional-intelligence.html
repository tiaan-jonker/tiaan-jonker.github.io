            "I want to be intelligent and smart.” That is a reasonable desire
            and I bet most wished it was so. High IQ envy is real we might even
            try a few tricks too increase our own. But there is something
            missing, something we probabily don't learn about until we are an
            adult. Your IQ is not the full story; there is a missing piece and I
            think the ancient Romans, specifically Marcus Aurelius, touched on
            some aspects of this something:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <i>
              “These are characteristics of the rational soul: self-awareness,
              self-examination, and self-determination… affection for its
              neighbours. Truthfulness. Humility… It reaps its own harvest… it
              succeeds in its own purpose.”
            </i>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <i> “Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself." </i>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This something is called “Emotional Intelligence”, and it's a
            different kind of intelligence than IQ. While IQ is important, after
            a certain threshold, our Emotional Intelligence (or EQ) starts to
            matter more.

              IQ will get you in the door with everyone else, but EQ sets you
              apart from them.</a
            >
            So our desire should rather be for a higher EQ, after all:

          <h4 class="article-title">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
          <p>
            EQ is about our ability to understand, evaluate, and manage our own
            emotions while using it in positive ways to communicate effectively,
            empathise, building relationships and relieving stress.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Daniel Goldman, the psychologist who popularised it,
            there are five components to EQ:
          </p>
          <div class="blog-list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> this is your ability to
                recognise, examine, understand and evaluate your emotions, mood,
                strengths, weaknesses and how it can impact people around you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Self-regulation:</strong> Self-awareness is life long
                skill that should be developed, but as you become more
                self-aware, and understand yourself better, you can exert
                greater self-regulation (or self-control). That is not the same
                as ignoring or suppressing what you feel or experience, it just
                means you become better at managing and also expressing those
                emotions at the appropriate time.
                <blockquote>
                  <i>
                    "Anyone can become angry - that is easy. But to be angry
                    with the right person, to the right degree, at the right
                    time, for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is
                    not easy" - Aristotle
                  </i>
                </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Motivation:</strong>
                not external motivation but rather internal or intrinsic
                motivation. Intrinsic motivation means that you are compelled to
                fulfilling your own internal needs and goals. Its our drive to
                keep going despite obstacles or adversity. External motivations
                such as money, fame, and recognition is not what drives and
                motivates you to push through.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Emotionally in tune:</strong> Empathy is about being
                able to tune into other peoples emotions and being able to
                understand how other people are feeling. More than that it
                involves our appropriate response based on whatever information
                we have gather about ourselves and others while appreciating how
                our words and actions affect other people.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Social skills:</strong>
                Understanding yourself and others better can be put to good use
                in our day to day life. Building and maintaining deep,
                meaningful relationships all depends on how well we interact
                with other people. Emotionally mature individuals are able to to
                actively listen without interruption, take feedback (good or
                bad) humbly, giving feedback at the appropriate time, and have
                good verbal communication and non-verbal communication skills.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h4 class="article-title">How is it different from IQ?</h4>
          <p>
            IQ stands for 'Intelligence Quotient'. It generally refers to our
            “fluid and crystallised intelligence” and the level of it is
            measured through a standardised test. The test is intended to assess
            and measure our logical abilities as well as reasoning and
            problem-solving skills. In short it generally refers to a person’s
            overall cognitive abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Breaking it down then, fluid intelligence is the ability to reason
            and analyse. We use fluid intelligence in situations where logic,
            pattern recognition and abstract thinking is required. Crystallised
            intelligence, on the other hand, is our knowledge acquired through
            education and experience. Think of crystallised intelligence as all
            the facts and information we acquire through life. As we get older
            our
            <a
              href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/fluid-crystallized-intelligence.html"
              class="general-links"
            >
              crystallised intelligence increases but our fluid intelligence
              declines.
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, IQ is generally a predictor of our “book smarts”,
            analytical skills, logical reasoning and overall cognitive
            abilities.
          </p>

          <h4 class="article-title">Why is it important?</h4>
          <p>
            Now coming back to the start of this article. There is nothing wrong
            with wanting to be more intelligent. The problem is that we have a
            one-dimensional perspective of intelligence. This leads wasted
            energy in trying to increase IQ or wishing it were higher. We now
            that there is the different kind of intelligence, EQ, that is just
            as, maybe even important that IQ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news is that EQ can actually be increased with deliberate
            practice. Equipped with greater EQ we can more easily build and
            maintain healthy relationships (personally and in the workplace),
            work in teams more effectively, understanding ourselves and others
            around us better and manage conflict appropriately. A better
            understanding of IQ and EQ enables us to spend our energies on what
            we can improve. Together they can lead to happier relationships
            whether they be with family, friends, or in business one. Not to
            mention a more successful life, whatever that means to you.
