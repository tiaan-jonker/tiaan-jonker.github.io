      </header>
      <p>CSS can sometimes appear to be a shallow puddle. Not too complex, not too deep, easy to navigate. 
        You add a few colours, change some font sizes, and specify the width and height of an image. You add 
        more and more elements and styling. Then you refresh the page and it's a mess. This joke sums it up nicely:</p>
      <p id="css-joke"><i>Two CSS properties walk into a bar. <br>
        A barstool in a completely different bar falls over.</i></p>
      <p>That shallow puddle somehow turned into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal" class="general-links">Lake Baikal.</a> 
        How did you even get there? </p>
      
      <p>Learning CSS can sometimes be frustrating, especially when elements don't behave intuitively. 
        Positioning elements is no exception. So in this post I will explain how the position property works. 
        We will cover four properties: </p>
        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <li>static</li>
            <li>relative</li>
            <li>fixed</li>
            <li>and the all powerful absolute positioning</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      
      <h4 class="article-title">Relative Position</h4>
      <p>To start off I have assembled a family of boxes below. The dashed line containing the three boxes is the 
        parent. The three containers within are the children namely: PINK (our main protagonist) and two twins 
        named Iden and Ticle:</p>

        <div class="parent-box-1 general-style">
          <div class="pink-1 center general-style size">PINK</div>
          <div class="iden center general-style size">IDEN...</div>
          <div class="ticle center general-style size">...TICLE</div>
        </div>

      <p>At this point it is important to note that all elements have default properties. In this 
        case the default position property of PINK and the twins (and all elements for that matter) is 
        "static". Keeping that in the following code (to move PINK down and right by 20px) ...</p>
      <pre>
        .pink {
          top: 20px;
          left: 20px;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>... won't work. So we need to change the default behaviour of our elements
         by changing the position property to relative: </p>
      <pre>
        .pink {
          position: relative;
          top: 20px;
          left: 20px;
        }
      </pre>

      <p>Refresh the page and we get:</p>

      <div class="parent-box-1 general-style">
        <div class="pink-2 center general-style size">PINK</div>
        <div class="iden center general-style size">IDEN...</div>
        <div class="ticle center general-style size">...TICLE</div>
      </div>

      <p>Now its working. By changing PINK's position property from static to relative we are 
        essentially level up and gain access to new properties, namely: 
        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <li>top</li>
            <li>bottom</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and left</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        (but wait! Why am I changing the top and left properties when I wanted to move it down and 
        to the right? See the bonus section below.)</p>
      
      <p>Here comes the important part. When we offsetted PINK by 20px down and to the right we 
        did that relative to where it was previously. Did you also notice something? The twins are 
        very considerate, they did not take the space of where PINK used to be. While we visually 
        moved PINK the space it occupied did not move.  </p>
      
      <h3 class="article-title">Absolute Positioning</h3>
      <p>USE WITH CAUTION. OVERUSE MIGHT BECOME ADDICTIVE. Not to be confused with Absolute vodka. 
        But it is powerful. Once you realise the power of absolute positioning it might be tempting
        to place everything absolutely. </p>
      <p>With absolute positioning you can place an element exactly where you want it to be on the 
        page. Lets start by changing PINK's position to absolute and the parents position to 
        relative (while keeping the offset properties the same). </p>
     <pre>
      .parent {
        position: relative;
      }

      .pink {
        position: absolute;
        top: 20px;
        left: 20px;
      }
    </pre>

    <div class="parent-box-2 general-style">
      <div class="pink-3 center general-style size">PINK</div>
      <div class="iden center general-style size">IDEN...</div>
      <div class="ticle center general-style size">...TICLE</div>
    </div>

      <p>Essentially relative and absolute positioning does the same thing but there are some 
        key differences: </p>
      
        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <li>PINK was taken out of the normal flow visually and now the twins are inconsiderate:
              PINK's space is now invaded. There was a visual change and a spacial change.</li>
            <li>the absolute position of PINK is positioned relative to the parent that has the 
              a property of relative. You are basically saying to PINK: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10487292/position-absolute-but-relative-to-parent" class="general-links">
                please position yourself in relation to the nearest ancestor which has position: 
                relative.</a></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>(Also, did you notice anything peculiar? See the bonus material for more information. 
          Hint: it has to do with the parents padding which is 10px.)</p>

      <p class="relative-position">To demonstrate the second point further lets add another box called: Big Parent 
        as below. Now when we shift position: relative from the smaller parent to Big Parent, PINK is now positioned
        <strong>absolutely, relative to the Big Parent:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <div class="big-parent general-style"> 
        <div class="parent-box-4 general-style">
          <div class="pink-6 center general-style size">PINK</div>
          <div class="iden center general-style size">IDEN...</div>
          <div class="ticle center general-style size">...TICLE</div>
        </div>
        <p>Big parent</p>
      </div>


      <h3 class="article-title">Position Fixed</h3>
      <p>Now finally our last positional property: fixed. It's very much the same as absolute, 
        however this time the element is positioned relative to your viewport.</p>
      <p>The best way to illustrate this would be change PINK's position to fixed and position it to 
        the bottom right corner of this screen. </p>
      <p>While it is commoly used for navigation bars I instead used the "sticky" position for 
        this website.</p>
      <p>I want to thank <a href="https://sindre-frisvold-git.github.io/" class="general-links">Sindre Frisvold</a> for reminding me of this neat trick.</p>
      
      <div class="pink-4 center general-style size">PINK</div>

      <h3 class="article-title">Bonus Section</h3>
      <p>We all love bonus sections.</p>

      <p><u>Bonus #1</u></p>
      <p>I just want to briefly cover positioning elements with top, bottom, right and left because that always 
        confused me in the past.</p>
      <p>If we want to move PINK up by 40px and to the right by 70px we add the following code:</p>
      <pre>
        .pink {
          position: relative;
          bottom: 40px;
          left: 70px;
        }
      </pre>
      <div class="parent-box-3 general-style">
        <div class="pink-5 center general-style size">PINK</div>
      </div>
      <p>Think of it this way:</p>
      <div class="blog-list">
        <ul>
          <li>You want to move it down by 40px? Add 40px worth of weight to the <strong>top</strong>.</li>
          <li>Want to move it right by 70px? Add 70px of "magic filler" to the <strong>left</strong>.</li>
          <li>The reverse for moving it to the left.</li>
          <li>Finally, want to move it up by 70px? Add 70px of support to the <strong>bottom</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><u>Bonus #2</u></p>   
      <p>Going back to where we change the position of PINK in "relative positioning" and 
        "absolute positioning". Did you notice we specified the same top and left off-set for both sections yet
        PINK is closer to its original position when it was absolute than when it was relative? 
      </p>   
      <p>What is happening here is that PINK is ignoring the parents padding of 10px when placed
        in absolute mode.
